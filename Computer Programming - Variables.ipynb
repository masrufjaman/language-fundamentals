    "- A variable name can hold a single type of value. For example, if variable **a** has been defined **int** type, then it can store only integer.\n",
    "- C programming language requires a variable creation, i.e., declaration before its usage in our program. We cannot use a variable name in our program without creating it, though programming language like Python allows us to use a variable name without creating it.\n",
    "- We can use a variable name only once inside our program. For example, if a variable **a** has been defined to store an integer value, then you cannot define **a** again to store any other type of value.\n",
    "- There are programming languages like Python, PHP, Perl, etc., which do not want to specify data type at the time of creating variables. So we can store integer, float, or long without specifying their data type.\n",
    "- We can give any name to a variable like **age, sex, salary, year1990** or anything else we like to give, but most of the programming languages allow to use only limited characters in their variables names. For now, we will suggest to use only **a....z, A....Z, 0....9** in our variable names and start their names using alphabets only instead of digits.\n",
    "- Almost none of the programming languages allow to start their variable names with a digit, so **1990year** will not be a valid variable name whereas **year1990** or **ye1990ar** are valid variable names."
